How to Use:

--------------
Converter Tab:
--------------

With this calculator you can convert your car setup from Dry road to Wet road, and vice-versa;
Just enter the setup your pilot is happy with, click the button, and Voila

You can also ajust your setup from Q1 to Q2 taking the changes of Temperature and Humidity in consideration.

  Pilot Tab:
--------------

Here you can calculate the OA of your pilot.

You can also find your "Car Window"

Let me explain what it is...

Lets say your pilot is happy with 600 in the brakes, but he says 601 is too much, and your pilot is happy with
500, but 499 is too low. With this data you know that your pilot is happy within a 100 value margin 
(in this case, from 500 to 600).

This means that probably the best value is 550.

But finding this margin is very hard when doing practice laps, and it changes from pilot to pilot, so we have a tool
to calculate it. Just enter your pilot data, hit calculate, and there you have a nice "Happy Zone" value

When making the practice laps, aim to find the Maximum or Minimum value your pilot is happy with in each part of the car.
When you have it, just add half the "Value to Add/Subtract" (That is HappyZone/2), if you found the Minimum,
or subtract the "Value to Add/Subtract" if you found the Maximum value.

Example:

The pilot is happy with 650 in the Engine, but not happy with 651
The pilot is happy with 450 in Suspension, but not happy with 449
Your "Value to Add/Subtract" is 30

With this data, the right value for engine should be 650-30= 620,
and fot the Suspension 450+30= 470!
